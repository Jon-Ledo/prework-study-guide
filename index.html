        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the foundation of any web page, and can be thought of as like the sturdy foundation of a house. CSS is how the house is styled and painted, and JavaScript determines how the doors/windows open, and how the lights turn on/off</li>
          <li>HTML uses elements to describe what we want tot he computer. An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:
            <ul>
              <li>Text Elements</li>
              <li>Image Elements</li>
              <li>Header Elements</li>
              <li>List Elements</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains meta information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is
          presented to users</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific
          elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
